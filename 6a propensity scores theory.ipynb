Next, compare the outcome for each individual who receive treatment with one or more who have not received treatment who have the same propensity score. The treatment effect is the average for all those comparisons.\n",

    "- These differences do not imply that one is always better, but that OLS and PSA have different strengths and weaknesses \n",
    "- The choice wil then depend on the data you have data and the assumptions you are wiling to make \n",
    "- In general:\n",
    "    - Standard applied OLS is usually parameteric i.e. you have to make assumptions about the **functional form** of the relationship between the cause and the effect (e.g. linearity). You do not need this in PSA. \n",
    "    - PSA often requires **more observations** than OLS to work well (since it assumes a functional form is can extrapolate between points)\n",
    "    - PSA **explicitly warns the user**, and drops observations, for which it cannot find a good control to compare against. \n",
    "    - OLS has well establoished formulas and algorithms for calculating **the standard error** of the estimates. Estimation of correct standard errors in PSA is more difficult.\n",
    "    - PSA is most intuitive and easy to apply if the **treatment is dichotemous** (treated vs. untreated), while OLS also works fine for continous treatment variables.\n",

    "- **Problem of dimensionality**: Assume you have n variables (age, gender, etc) and you want the individuals you compare to have the same value for each variable: Same age, same gender, same severity etc. How many individuals do you need to make this method work?\n",
    "    - Simplification: \n",

    "    - How many subgroups (s) are there?\n",

    "    - With 8 variables, we have 256 possible subgroups and we would like to have many people who are treated and not-treated in each sub-groups in order to do matching\n",
    "    - In this case we would need at the very least more than 512 individuals, but probably and preferrably a lot more (comparing only two individuals in each sub-groups does not inspire confidence!).\n",
    "- Solution: Instead of matching on every single variable, we use all the variables to create a single number (the probability of receiving treatment, also called the propensity score) and we compare individuals who have the same propensity score. This eliminates the problem of dimensionality since we now only need to match individuals on one variable (the propensity score) and not all the variables.\n",
